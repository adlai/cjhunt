* TODO factor out bitcoind interface library
needs to be a wholly separate library
* TODO html templates
** TODO block
** TODO tx
** TODO coinjoin
* TODO caching
** TODO figure out right cache schemes for each of:
*** TODO blockjoins
*** TODO coin graph traversal
**** next-sizes
**** prev-sizes
**** bounded subsets
*** DONE coinjoinp-cdr                                               :MEMO:
*** DONE coinjoinp                                                 :NORMAL:
>99% of the calls will delegate to coinjoinp-cdr. this is not premature
 optimization, since we're really not that interested in cjmining [yet]
** DONE pick memoization library:
+ fare-memoization https://github.com/fare/fare-memoization
+ function-cache https://github.com/AccelerationNet/function-cache
we use fare-memoization, for now.
* DONE demacrolet define-rpc
needs to generate default methods from (btc:rpc "help")
* DONE snoop local node config
